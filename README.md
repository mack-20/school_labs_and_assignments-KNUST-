## Assignment: Time to Seconds Converter

**File**: `assignement.cpp`  
Converts a time value entered in `HH:MM:SS` format into its total equivalent in seconds. Includes input validation for format and time ranges.

**Topics Covered:**
- Input validation
- Character handling
- Inline functions

---

## Lab 1: Data Types and Input/Output

**File**: `lab1.cpp`  
Demonstrates use of basic data types, conditional (ternary) operator, arrays, and basic input/output operations. Also includes system commands for screen clearing and delays.

**Topics Covered:**
- Primitive types
- String arrays
- Conditional logic
- Using `system()` commands (platform-specific)

---

## Lab 2: BMI Calculator

**File**: `lab2.cpp`  
Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) from user input (height in cm, weight in kg) and gives feedback based on standard BMI categories.

**Topics Covered:**
- Mathematical calculations
- `setprecision` for formatting
- Conditional logic

---

## Lab 3: Multi-Function Tool

**File**: `lab3.cpp`  
Provides a menu-driven program that allows the user to:
1. Calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers (using recursion)
2. Convert a height in cm to feet and inches
3. Generate a Fibonacci sequence up to a limit

**Topics Covered:**
- Functions with pointers
- Recursion
- Menu-driven programs

---

## Lab 4: Quadrilateral Area (OOP)

**File**: `lab4.cpp`  
Defines a simple `Quadrilateral` class to compute area of rectangles or squares.

**Topics Covered:**
- Basic class definition
- `this` pointer
- Object instantiation

---

## Lab 5: YouTube Channel Class

**File**: `lab5.cpp`  
Implements a YouTube channel class with operations like subscribing, unsubscribing, and publishing videos.

**Topics Covered:**
- Classes with constructors and destructors
- Encapsulation
- `list` from STL
- Basic object interaction

---

## Lab 6: Pointers and Array Operations

**File**: `lab6.cpp`  
Uses pointers to find the largest and smallest elements in an array, with helper functions for both.

**Topics Covered:**
- Pointers and references
- Array traversal
- Function parameter passing using pointers

---

## Getting Started

To compile and run any of the labs or the assignment:

```bash
g++ lab1.cpp -o lab1
./lab1
